# Timeline by Michael Crichton

Timeline is a good piece of speculative fiction that considers with careful detail what could happen with a time machine to the past. The plot avoids butterfly effects by considering a multiverse instead, a kind of read-only past that is fairly refreshing for a time travel story.


The book does read like many of Crichton's other novels: a expert team that doesn't get the full picture, from some corporate overlords that don't care or are too greedy to prepare everyone enough. If you enjoy this trace of a plotline consider jurassic park and Prey, they work very similarly.


The characters in Timeline could use some work: they certainly have their own personality but they are fairly trite and I found myself struggling to empathize and care for some of the characters. The standout here is Marek: more than a simple highly-competent lancer character, Marek is a great leader and dedicated to his craft. His ending was pleasantly surprising!


Altogether Timeline is not Crichton's greatest work, but as a longtime fan Timeline is a great addition to his collective works.
