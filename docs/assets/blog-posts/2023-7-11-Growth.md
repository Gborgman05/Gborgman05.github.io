# Growth

I've been working a lot recently on writing out and saying intentions for the day. Something more general than a goal and a little more specific than a vision. I have been revolving around the phrase "grow as much as possible, as sustainably as possible". I think that sustainability aspect is one that I need to work on. In school I don't think they focus on sustainability when it comes to personal engagements. I hope to learn this better in the future. 

1. Protect your sleep schedule
2. Do things that truly excite you, consistently
3. Build on top of what you are doing

## Protect your sleep
TODO
## Excitement
TODO
## Extend

To extend is to build on something you've already started. It is easy to start on a shiny new thing, but to put in the hard and sometimes dull consistent effort to build something valuable. This is something I have learned making habits around areas is very useful. 

I would work on SAT prep words with my friend Arthur every day in my boring marketing class in high school. We made a habit of going through it next to each other and trying to learn. 
I remember this effervescent memory because I think it still benefits me to this day :D
