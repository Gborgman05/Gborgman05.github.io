# Growth

I've been working a lot recently on writing out and saying intentions for the day. Something more general than a goal and a little more specific than a vision. I have been revolving around the phrase "grow as much as possible, as sustainably as possible". I think that sustainability aspect is one that I need to work on. In school I don't think they focus on sustainability when it comes to personal engagements. I hope to learn this better in the future.
